### **With Cline (IDE-First):**
- **Market Fit**: Aligns with mainstream developer tools
- **Target**: General developers, teams, enterprises
- **Adoption**: Faster user acquisition due to existing user base
- **Risk**: Loses unique terminal positioning

## 🏆 **Recommendation: Aider with Cline Evaluation**

### **Primary Choice: Aider**
**Rationale:**
- Perfect alignment with SparkPlug's terminal-first philosophy
- Maintains unique cyberpunk aesthetic and differentiation
- Git-native safety and workflow integration
- Smaller but dedicated user base (15K vs 56K stars)

### **Cline Integration: Phase 2 Consideration**
**Strategy:**
- Monitor Cline adoption and terminal support
- Consider web dashboard integration if Cline adds terminal capabilities
- Evaluate hybrid approach if market demands broader accessibility

### **Immediate Action Plan:**
1. **Proceed with Aider integration** as planned
2. **Monitor Cline development** for terminal features
3. **Consider UV/Ruff integration** for enhanced Python DX
4. **Plan hybrid architecture** for future web extensions

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Week 1-2: Aider Integration**
